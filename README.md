# rn-harness

> **GitHub template.** Click **Use this template** at the top of the
> repo page to spin up a new React Native project pre-wired for the
> [harness engineering](https://walkinglabs.github.io/learn-harness-engineering)
> workflow — AI coding agents and humans on the same page from day one.

A React Native (Expo SDK 54, TypeScript, Expo Router) starter that
applies the harness-engineering course's twelve principles in concrete
form. The goal: agents and humans both finish features they pick up —
no overreach, no under-finishing, no declaring victory from code that
doesn't run.

If you are an agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor, …) opening this repo,
read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) and [`PROGRESS.md`](./PROGRESS.md)
first. The rest of this file is for humans.

## What's included

### The five subsystems (Lecture 02), wired in

| Subsystem | Lives in |
| --- | --- |
| Instructions | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/*.md` |
| State | `features/*.json`, `PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `git log` |
| Verification | `npm run verify` → typecheck + lint + jest + schema |
| Scope | `features/` directory (one file per feature), WIP=1 |
| Session lifecycle | `init.sh` (start), `scripts/check-clean-state.sh` (end) |

### Out of the box

- **Expo SDK 54** managed workflow, Expo Router 6, TypeScript strict.
- **Harness scaffolding** — routing docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`),
  short `PROGRESS.md` (current state) and append-only `DECISIONS.md`
  (design log), `features/` directory with one JSON file per feature
  and a filename↔id-enforcing validator.
- **Initialization phase** — `./init.sh` checks Node version, installs
  deps, runs typecheck + lint + schema, tails `PROGRESS.md`. Fails
  loudly so the next session knows the foundation is broken.
- **Baseline gate** — `npm run verify` runs the same checks as `init.sh`
  plus the test suite. Run this before every commit.
- **End-of-session gate** — `npm run harness:clean-state` checks the
  working tree, baseline status, debug markers, and that
  `PROGRESS.md` has a current *Next steps* section.
- **Naming standard** — feature IDs (`<category>-<slug>`, e.g.
  `ui-home`), branch names (`<type>/<feature-id>`, e.g.
  `feat/ui-home`), and commit subjects (`<type>(<feature-id>): …`)
  all carry the same identifier. Enforced by
  `scripts/feature-list-check.js` and the CI invariants script.
- **End-to-end testing** — [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev) flows
  in `.maestro/`, run via `npm run e2e`. Wrapper script
  (`scripts/run-maestro.sh`) drops screenshots and JUnit reports into
  `tmp/diagnostics/` keyed by timestamp.
- **Sim/emulator helpers** — `npm run sim:ios` and `npm run sim:android`
  boot a simulator (separate from `npm run ios/android` which builds
  the app).
- **GitHub Actions CI** — `.github/workflows/harness.yml` runs two
  jobs: `static` (typecheck/lint/jest/schema + harness invariants on
  ubuntu, ~1 min, required) and `e2e-ios` (Maestro on a real
  simulator on macOS, advisory, label-gated to control runner cost).

### Conspicuously *not* included

- No `lib/` with speculative utilities. Add it when you have a real
  consumer.
- No `__tests__/` with placeholder tests. Add a test when you have
  behavior to test.
- No design system, no auth, no networking layer. The harness is
  about *how* you build; *what* you build is yours to decide.

## Quick start (after using the template)

```bash
nvm use 22         # any Node ≥ 20
./init.sh          # install + typecheck + lint + schema; tails PROGRESS.md
npm run verify     # baseline gate
npm run start      # i = iOS sim, a = Android emulator, w = web
```

## First things to edit

When you spin up a new repo from this template:

1. **Replace this README** with your project's description. The harness
   discipline doesn't go in your README — it's already in the `docs/`
   and `AGENTS.md` files.
2. **`app.json`** — set `name`, `slug`, `ios.bundleIdentifier`,
   `android.package`. Currently `rn-harness-scaffold` (carryover from
   `create-expo-app`).
3. **`features/`** — delete the example `ui-home.json` /
   `ui-feature-list.json` entries (they're scaffold-shaped, not your
   features). Add your own feature files; the filename must equal the
   `id` field.
4. **`PROGRESS.md`** — rewrite the *Next steps* section for your
   project. Clear *Known issues* to an empty state. Feature status
   itself lives in `features/*.json`, not here.
5. **`DECISIONS.md`** — keep the format, clear the entries. Log your
   own decisions as they come up.
6. **`package.json`** — change `name` from `rn-harness`.

The scripts, `docs/`, and harness scaffolding stay as-is — that's the
point. Don't fork-and-customize the harness; use it as written.

## Development loop

```
1. ./init.sh                   → environment healthy
2. read PROGRESS.md            → next best step
3. pick one feature            → WIP = 1
4. implement + npm run verify  → typecheck, lint, test, schema
5. walk verification list      → in a real sim (see .maestro/)
6. flip feature → done         → status, passes, commitSha
7. commit, push, open PR       → CI runs the same gates
8. npm run harness:clean-state → leave a clean state
```
